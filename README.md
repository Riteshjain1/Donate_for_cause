**Abstract:**</br>
**_help++_** is a form of internet-enabled fundraising platform. Our primary reason for making this project is to
come up with a charity crowdfunding platform with the necessary tools for the public to create, fund, and
support good causes all over the world. This project makes the process of crowdfunding more accessible
which is open to all and can be carried out on the terms of NGOs and donors. NGOs can decide on the
amount they want to raise and the timescale to raise the funds. The donor can donate an unrestricted amount
of money without worrying about the NGO’s legitimacy. This Platform makes the fundraising process faster
and more efficient than the traditional methods. This Platform is secure and all NGOs and Donors are
verified.

**Introduction:**</br>
This project makes the process of crowdfunding more accessible which is open to all and can be carried out
on the terms of NGOs and donors. NGOs can decide on the amount they want to raise and the timescale to
raise the funds. The money it does bring can be very different from a traditional investment as funds raised
through crowdfunding are unrestricted, and can be a quick way to start raising funds. Research suggests that
when a fundraiser is closer to its goal, people feel their contribution will be more effective and donate to
interested NGOs. So, with this platform fundraisers can even get a good start and help them get more
support.

**Problem Statement:**</br>
Multiple charities and NGOs all over the world can attest to the difficulty of acquiring funds and the
difficulty is exacerbated due to the lack of good communication medium and also donors facing the problem
of finding trustworthy platforms to donate.

**Objective:**</br>
The main objective of the system is to computerize the maintenance of the donors and NGO details, with
donors having a good interface to get to know about the various NGOs all over the world that require
donations and also NGOs having a better communication medium to reach people and convey their
objectives and mottos and gather funds for the good cause.

**Proposed methodology:**</br>
There are two main roles namely</br>
**• NGOs**</br>
**• Donors**</br>

**NGOs:** Non-Governmental organizations. There can be different types of NGOs based on the sector like
age care, agriculture, animal welfare, child education, disability, disaster management, rural development,
women, environmental issues, and tribal people. Organizations can register by choosing their sector and also
provide sufficient proof to prove their legitimacy. The documents are then sent to the admin for verification.
If the documents fail to prove their legitimacy, then the account will be suspended temporarily. On
successful verification, the organizations can log in and add further descriptions about their mission, vision,
and aim. They can also add their sponsors, which can popularize their brand name and in turn attract donors.
They can also join with other NGOs to work together and collect funds. They can also check the number of
donors and the total funds collected per day. They can also view the donor’s account and gift them their
merchandise for a heavy donation.

**Donors:** People who donate money to charities. They can make an account by registering in the portal. On
successful verification can log in and can browse through all the NGOs based on their sectors. When an NGO
is selected, the donor can view its information such as sponsors, events organized in the past by NGO etc. The
donor can donate an unrestricted amount of money without worrying about the NGO’s legitimacy. After
donating to an NGO, a referral link will be provided, which the donor can share with his social network to
collect more funds. If 10 new people register themselves on the website and donate to the NGOs through a
referral link, then the donor becomes a Special Donor. A donor can also check his/her history of donations.</br></br></br>
